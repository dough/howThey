<h1>How They ...  <h1>
		Any time I want to be able to quickly find information about
how something is done, and it is not best to be looked for under a specific
place uch as <strong>Mathematics</strong> or <strong>Computer Science</strong>
it will be put here. The single exception will be when I made specific decisions
on how it is to be done on thisite then it will be placed under <a href="http://dougharris.github.io/howI">howI</a>.
<h2>What is GitHub</h2>
	GitHub has long been the place where software developers
	shared their work. I used it in my classes on software development
	to show how groups could collaborate. The basic tool is
	a command called "git" which is rather complex but extremely
	powerful. The whole thing is based on "repositories", which
	are directories whose tree has a certain structure, each paired
	with a remote repository on GitHub.
	
	Recently they started running a service called GitHub Pages
	which makes git available for websites that are to
	be used for sharing information and projects in general,
	in particular for personal websites.

	Once you have obtained  username in GitHub you can set up
	a repository username.github.io, and that will make a website
	http[s]://username.github.io automatically available. There
	are then various ways to set up other repositories for projects
	if you wish.
<ul>
<li>
	<a href="https://pages.github.com">GitHub Pages</a>
	This set of pages announces and describes the service.
	If only it were as easy as they describe it to get started!
	But we are now on the way!
</li>
<li>
	<a href="https://git-scm.com/docs/credentials">Git official reference</a>
	Included here mainly so you can see how "git-people" write for each other.
	Remember that they are seasoned software developers so  to them it is easy to read.
	HAH!
